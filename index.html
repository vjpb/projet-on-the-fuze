              <h3>PETER BREAKS THROUGH</h3>
              <article>
                All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will
                grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was
                two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked
                another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must
                have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to
                her heart and cried, “Oh, why can’t you remain like this for
                ever!” This was all that passed between them on the subject, but
                henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up.

                For a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they
                would be able to keep her, as she was another mouth to feed. Mr.
                Darling was frightfully proud of her, but he was very
                honourable.

                    “It is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet,” Wendy said,
                    sighing. She was a tidy child. She explained in quite a
                    matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter sometimes.
